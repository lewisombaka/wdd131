                Nairobi, the vibrant capital city of Kenya, captivates with its blend of modernity and rich cultural heritage.
                <br>
                From its bustling markets and iconic skyscrapers to its lush green spaces and wildlife sanctuaries, Nairobi offers a unique experience at every corner. It's a melting pot of cultures, where traditional Maasai beadwork meets contemporary art galleries and international cuisine.
                <br>
                Nairobi is not just a city; it's a gateway to Kenya's breathtaking landscapes, including the world-famous Maasai Mara and Amboseli National Park. Here, wildlife enthusiasts can witness the Big Five and marvel at the annual wildebeest migration.
